Creating a cohesive, functioning men’s tribe is incredibly difficult today. While I’m part of various online groups, the one that has my biggest investment involves my real-life friends.

We’ve been trying to do this for six years and have had dozens of guys come for a few months and then disappear.

I’ve found a few key things along the way.

The men involved have to be willing to commit the time. It has to be a priority for them to show up to meetups, trips, and events.

They have to be willing to push themselves. Male friendship is rooted in conquest and guys who only want life to be comfortable are incredibly uncomfortable around men who are looking for the next challenge.

It needs sincerity - mens groups are so easily turned into something ironic and most guys do it because it’s scary and risky to be sincere. It doesn’t have to be so formal that you have a president and monthly dues, but it does require structure and structure is impossible with irony.

Ideally you would have proximity, frequency, and intensity. I see these guys every other week and wish it were every day. If we were neighbors our wives and kids would know each other better. We’d lift together, help with house projects, do regular meals, etc. But the intensity of doing long weekend ski trips, big hikes, or races and challenges is just as important.

We’re still learning as we go, but it’s worth the effort to figure this out.
